# Chemistry Python

This is a starter setup as an idea for an article. It includes ChemPy, SymPy, and JupyterLab.

ChemPy might be an undergraduate chemistry suitable tool?  (I haven't worked with it at all, so I don't know.)  SymPy is a good all around tool for symbolic math -- see [Solving Math Equations in Python and Jupyter](https://codesolid.com/sympy-solving-math-equations-in-python/) for an introduction if you haven't used it.

# Usage: 
(Note:  this assumes python and pip refer to python3 and pip3, if not, substitute those).

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # Linux or Mac
# On windows use instead of last line:
# venv\Scripts\activate.bat
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter lab
```

From there you can create a notebook via the launcher as usual.
